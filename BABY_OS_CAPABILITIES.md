## The Vision: Clarity in the Chaos

My wife and I are expecting our first baby in April. As teachers, we love data-crunching but won't have time for it once the baby arrives. Baby OS answers the critical questions instantly: "When did they last eat?" "How long have they been awake?"

Traditional trackers lock your data away. Baby OS uses Craft as the core, keeping your data in a beautiful, searchable, and permanent format that you own.

## Craft: The Center of the Experience

Baby OS doesn't hide Craft; it proves Craft is a world-class productivity app that becomes even more powerful with the right tools.

### 1. Flexible Interaction
- **The Power User Way:** Open Craft directly to manage records, add photos, write long-form memories, or organize medical history in a familiar interface.
- **The Rapid Logging Way:** Use iOS Shortcuts for data entry that takes seconds, lowering the friction of repetitive tasks.

### 2. Seamless Synergy
- **Craft as the API:** The dashboard connects via the Craft Connect API. Everything you log is a structured block, making data accessible for visualization while remaining fully editable in Craft.
- **Apple Shortcuts:** One-tap logging for naps, feeds, diapers, and doctor visits. It can even generate handoff summaries for partners.
- **MCP (AI Insights):** Connect to Claude via the Model Context Protocol to analyze sleep patterns or log events using natural language.
- **Calendar Bridge:** Leverage Craft’s native Apple Calendar integration to turn events into structured logs. Work meetings and baby milestones, unified at last.

## The Dashboard: Your Command Center

A premium, high-contrast overview of your baby’s day including sleep (wake windows), feeds, diapers, and pediatrician notes.

Everything runs locally on your device via Craft’s API. There is no middleman server. The code is public on GitHub, transparent, and maintenance-free. Even if the project is never updated, your dashboard will keep working for your family.
